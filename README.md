# **Real Estate Data Analysis Project**

## Overview   

The Real Estate Data Analysis Project is an exploration and analysis of real estate listings, with a specific emphasis on predicting the totalArea of properties using regression methods. This project aims to build and evaluate regression models that capture the relationship between various features and the target variable totalArea. By employing regression techniques, I seek to provide estimations of property sizes based on key property features.
